Hey! My name is Jordan and I am fairly new to the world of coding. 
As of right now, this is mostly for projects that I have worked on during my tenure at Tech Elevator. 
Before TE, my creative projects tended to lean more towards knitting and occasionally drawing or painting. 
When not doing those, I play a lot of long form puzzle games such as the Witness, Talos Principle, and Superliminal,
which, for fellow Doctor Who fans, was narrated by David Tennet.

I am having fun taking a deeper dive into coding and plan on adding more personal projects as they come into existence!

Thanks for stopping by!
